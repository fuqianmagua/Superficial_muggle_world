Quarto includes many more built in output formats (and many more options for customizing each format). Quarto also has native features for special project types like Websites, Books, and Blogs (rather than relying on external packages).\nTo use a format in Quarto you use the format key rather than the output key as you did in R Markdown. Here’s a comparison of equivalent format specifications:\n\n\nR Markdown\ntitle: \"My Document\" output:   html_document:     toc: true     number_sections: true     css: styles.css\n\nQuarto\ntitle: \"My Document\" format:   html:     toc: true     number-sections: true     css: styles.css"
